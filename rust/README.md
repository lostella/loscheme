TODOs:
- add standard environment with a couple of builtin procedures (sum, product)
- finish evaluation
- add test for user-defined procedures (successor, product, something like that)
- add all remaining special forms
- add all remaining built-in procedures

Questions:
- what does .into() do?
- diff between ? and unwrap
- unwrap_or and so on?
