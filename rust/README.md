TODOs:
- expressions, which can be either
    - a keyword (special forms, like "define")
    - an identifier (variable name, function name)
    - a literal
    - a list of expressions
- environments
- procedures
- evaluation
- all special forms
- built-in procedures

Questions:
- what does .into() do?
- diff between ? and unwrap
- unwrap_or and so on?
